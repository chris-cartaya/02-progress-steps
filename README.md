## Description

This project demonstrates how to create a progress bar with multiple steps, commonly used in multi-step forms or shopping carts. Users can navigate through the steps using 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. The project starts at step one, and the progress bar updates visually as users navigate through the steps. This project was created by following the second video in the Udemy tutorial "50 Projects In 50 Days" titled "Day 2 - Progress Steps". While the core functionality follows the tutorial, a few minor modifications have been made for this version.

## Modifications

- **CSS**: Added `*::before, *::after` for the `box-sizing: border-box;` declaration on the universal selector.
- **JavaScript**:
  1. Renamed the `update` function to `updateProgress` for better clarity.
  2. Changed the variable names for the buttons to `prevBtn` and `nextBtn` instead of `prev` and `next` for readability.
  3. Introduced the `progressWidth` variable to separate the width calculation from its application to the progress bar for improved code clarity.
